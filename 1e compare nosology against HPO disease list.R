# the advantage is that it documents clearly which changes have been made

# the downside is that it is a lot of typing, we have to specify the column to update each time,
# and I also have to switch back and forth between my view of nosology_antijoin_by_gene and this script
# to write down these changes
# see further down for how to do this with DataEditR instead
