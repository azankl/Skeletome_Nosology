#Merge Nosology with DDG2P data
#uses the Nosology object created in 'Convert AJMG Table to Nosology object'
#IMPORTANT: DDG2P_1_12_2021.csv is the last version of DDG2P that used G2Ps older nomenclature that includes functional consequence terms like 'activating'
#So need to merge DDG2P_1_12_2021 to newer versions of DDG2P
#and then merge this combined DDG2P to the Nosology
