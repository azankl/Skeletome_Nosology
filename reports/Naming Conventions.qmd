## Notes on Naming Conventions

### Disease Names

#### Resources

-   MONDO: disease names should be lower case, unless they are proper names: e.g. lung cancer, Parkinson disease. See here: [OBO Foundry Naming Conventions](https://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-012-naming-conventions.html)

-   Orphanet has detailed rules on naming diseases: [Orphanet Rare Disease Nomenclature](https://www.orpha.net/orphacom/cahiers/docs/GB/eproc_Disease_naming_rules_in_English_PR_R1_Nom_01.pdf)

-   OMIM's rules for disease naming: [What's in a name? Issues to consider when naming Mendelian disorders](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-020-0851-0)

#### Capitalisation

#### Gene-based subtypes

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
