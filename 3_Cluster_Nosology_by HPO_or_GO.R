#Notes on how to cluster nosology by HPO or Go terms
#based on this paper: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22573485/

#1 get list of all OMIM listed disorders in Nosology
#2 get list of all HPO terms for each disease (filter HPO annotations list for Nosology disorders)
#3 or use GO_terms, already built in, might be easier
#4 look at network packages for the clustering, need to colour the disorders based on their Nosology group
