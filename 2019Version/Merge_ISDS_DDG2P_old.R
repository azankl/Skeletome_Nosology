#trying to create a clean ISDS list from original ISDS table

#Use RNotebook to document the merging process, will help with future publication

#look at:
#Nosology entries with no gene
#Nosology entries with no DMIM
#try inner join on DMIM to get an idea how much already is covered in G2P

#Goal
#1: get a list of all skeletal dysplasias already in DDG2P
#to create the first Skeletal G2P list.
#
#2: get a list of all skeletal dysplasias that should be included in Notion
#with DDG2P data filled in where available
#this list is bigger as it includes:
#disorders with a gene but not yet included in DDG2P
#disorders without a gene

#Thoughts on how to solve the many inconsistencies:
#Start with disorders in ISDS that have a gene
#use MONDO as the identifier (not DMIM)\
#create new MONDO-IDs for ISDS disorders with a gene, if does not already exist
